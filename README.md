# Fire and Ice (with a slice of pie)

Fire and Ice lets you optimize and personalize your spaces. Set up a \$35 Raspberry Pi device in any room (set up multiple!) and keep track of each room's temperature and humidity from our easy-to-use dashboard! The dashboard shows you both metrics over time and a snapshot average. Easily switch between sensors, so you can compare different rooms, and track your space's environment in real time!
